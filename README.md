# Data Science Project 

This repository contains the implementation of various matrix operations for both sparse and dense matrices. It's part of a data science project exploring matrix manipulations and performance profiling.

## Features

- Implementation of matrix classes `SparseMatrix` and `DenseMatrix`.
- Methods for performing scalar multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, and matrix-matrix multiplication.
- Sparse matrix operations that handle addition, subtraction, and multiplication efficiently.
- Profiling and performance analysis for identifying bottlenecks in matrix operations.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexisvannson/data_science_project_2.git
